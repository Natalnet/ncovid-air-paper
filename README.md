## Project Language

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

## Folder structure and Code

The main code is on [final_file_forecast_SPSP.ipynb](final_file_forecast_SPSP.ipynb). 

Folder [experiments](experiments) contains all files (models and errors) used to generate the plots presented in the paper. Some of the files names are in portuguese, so a quick translation is: mortes (Deaths), casos (Cases), temperatura (Temperature). 

Experiment [casos-aqi-temp-humid_mortes](experiments/casos-aqi-temp-humid_mortes) wasn't added to the paper due to poor performance.

## Dataset

The data used to train the models is on file [df_spsp_pred.csv](df_spsp_pred.csv).
